## Introduction
This web application is a **Pokémon guessing game**.  

- The **homepage** introduces the game’s theme: testing the user’s knowledge of Pokémon.  
- When the user navigates to the **game page**, they see a hero image of a Pokémon silhouette.  
- The user can type their guess into a text box and submit it.  
- Two buttons are provided:  
  - **Submit Guess** → checks the answer.  
  - **Next Pokémon** → loads a new random Pokémon.  
- Correct answers display a green “Correct!” message.  
- Incorrect answers display a red “Incorrect!” message.  
- A running tally is kept throughout the game.  
- At the end of 20 rounds, the user is given a final score (e.g., `18/20`).  
- After the results, the game resets so the user can play again.
